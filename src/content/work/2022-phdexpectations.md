Previous research shows that one key factor affecting the rate of degree completion among doctoral students is a clear understanding of what is expected of them in order to complete the program. This paper seeks to investigate perspectives of CS Ph.D. students from underrepresented groups in order to understand how they form expectations and how they fulfill them.
